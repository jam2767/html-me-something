            <h2>Past Projects</h2>
            <h3>LaunchCode Desk</h3>
            <p>I needed a workspace for LC101, and since we got rid of our old desk 
                when we move our family back to Missouri from Massachusetts, I decided
                to build one. It cost me about $55 in materials, and several late nights
                in the garage after the kids went to bed, but I put together a functional
                and decent looking desk using cheap hardware store lumber, a jigsaw,
                a brad nailer, an oscillating tool, hammer & nails, wood glue, sandpaper, 
                and a few hidden screws. The finish is a whitewash I made by diluting chalk 
                paint with some water, and the top has some water-based polyurethane to protect 
                from water damage and scratches.</p>
            
            <h3>"Makeup Vanity"</h3>
            <p>Another build on a budget was a makeup vanity for my spouse. She wanted a
                small "vanity" where she could put her jewelry box and do her makeup. Not
                that we're actually going anywhere in the time of Covid. This isn't a true vanity
                since there aren't any drawers, but it's a small, slightly fancy table. Supplies
                cost $60 this time because we wanted it to match existing furniture, so I used a walnut
                colored stain. Since the desk was made from cheap softwood lumber again (sanded plywood
                and pine 2 x 2 furring strips) I had to use a wood conditioner before staining. Otherwise,
                the stain would have been blotchy, and I would have been sad. Also, if you can afford
                more expensive wood, buy it. Sanding furring strips is a pain because they are cut so rough.
            </p>

            <h3>Nice Ash Bench</h3>
            <p>"When life gives you invasive insects that kill your trees, make a bench!" 
                After felling a dead 30 ft White Ash tree that was killed by Emerald Ash Borer (an
                invasive insect wreaking havoc on Ash trees in the Midwest) I wanted to make a couple
                of benches that could be used by our family when we're spending time in the yard. I used
                my electric battery-powered chainsaw to freehand rip-cut a log in half, then I rip-cut
                a smaller log in half to make the legs. I notched the bottom of the bench and attached
                the legs by drilling a couple of holes and pounding in wood dowels with a mallet. This
                once just cost me some time and supplies that I already had around the house. The 
                bench isn't completely done, I still need to sand the top and coat it with some high gloss
                spar urethane, but it's done enough to sit on!

            <h2>Present Projects</h2>
            <p>It's generous to call these "present" projects, but I've rough-cut the wood and it's drying, 
                so technically they're all "in-progress".</p>
            <h3>Live Edge Floating Shelf</h3>
            <p>The Ash tree from the yard will (hopefully)
                provide enough usable wood for projects for years to come. I have a board I cut
                freehand using a chainsaw technique I found in a video by 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCc1ufNROdAxto9Fr0jnEE2Q">Advoko Makes</a>.
                I'm letting it dry in our basement and hoping that it won't crack too bad while it dries.
                I've painted the ends to slow drying, which helps to prevent/reduce splitting as wood dries.
                Hopefully it will look something like the picture below when I'm done. 
            </p>
            
            <h3>Cookie Stools</h3>
            <p>Tree cookies taste terrible, but they look cool. I've cut half a dozen cookies and 
                slathered on thick coats of paint in the hopes that they will dry slow enough that
                they won't develop fatal cracks. I'm planning to take some smaller limbs I have drying 
                and make small camp stools (like the ones below) for the family.

            <h3>Live Edge End Tables</h3>
            <p>Scientifically speaking, invasive species suck. However, sometimes you can make cool
                stuff out of ecological disasters. <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/business/local/
                entrepreneur-turns-nuisance-bush-honeysuckle-to-functional-furniture/article_
                6d009b59-115d-5858-aead-a3591aff664c.html">Dale Dufer</a> is a local woodworker and the inspiration
                for the end tables that I want to make out of some of the cookies I've cut from our
                Ash tree. We also have an abundance of bush honeysuckle along our back fence line. This
                lovely invasive species was brought to the US and planted <em>intentionally</em>
                as an ornamental shrub. Now it takes over wherever it's found, crowding out native species 
                and harshing my mellow.</p>

            <h2>Future Projects</h2>
            <h3>Joiner's Mallet</h3>
                <p>There are a lot of ways to do woodworking. Some people specialize in using hand tools.
                I hope do a good bit of using hand tools in the years to come, and one of universally
                accepted tasks for a novice woodworker of this type is to craft their own Joiner's Mallet.
                I have several sections of our Ash tree that I've set aside for this project and I'll be
                using the design made very popular by the prodigous Paul Sellers. The videos below show
                the process I'll be following to make my first mallet.

            <h3>Joiner's Workbench</h3>
                <p>A solid workbench is a must have for any woodworker, and I don't have one. Currently
                    I use a couple of sturdy sawhorses and a piece or two of plywood for most of my work.
                    The aspect I miss out on most with this setup is a place to put a vice. There are a million
                    and one plans for benches out there, but I like the look (and materials price) of
                    something like what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCj4SLNED1DiNPHComZTCbzw">Rex Krueger</a> 
                    does in the video below. It's sturdy, cheap, and has potential for added features (like a vice) as I need/want them.
                    I hope to have this built within the next year or two.
